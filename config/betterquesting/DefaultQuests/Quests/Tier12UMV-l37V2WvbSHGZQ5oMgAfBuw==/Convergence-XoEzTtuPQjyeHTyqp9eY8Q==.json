You need to have a full discount for the Overclocks to occur, and the extra power cost is instead alleviated with more of the §l§6§r§l§asame§r §rcatalyst.\n\n[note]This is extremely power and catalyst hungry. You can try upgrading all of your DTPFs if you want. But the recommendation is to use them on the slow recipes that you forge passively.\n\nYou have to specify the catalyst in the GUI by right clicking the Convergence button. It has to be the same as the recipe being run.[/note]\n\n[warn]The Fuel Discount will decay 100x faster[/warn]"
